Monkey Parkour is a infinity runner
Complete levels and cover as much distance as possible.
Every 1 meter = 1 banana. For bananas, you can improve your monkey, for example: by buying a strong tail or a dash for it. You can also decorate it by buying various skins.
Every 50 meters = 1 ruby. For rubies, you can respawn at the last place where you stood.
